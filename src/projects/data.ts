I often found myself looking up the statistics of Pokemon in my spare time, but most websites make it difficult to quickly compare those stats. I went into this project with the goal of creating a layout where it would be much quicker and easier to make those comparisons, deepening my API knowledge and learning about web workers along the way.",
